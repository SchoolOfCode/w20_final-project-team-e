# EMISSION IMPOSSIBLE

Emission Impossible is an eco journey planner. We calculate the users mileage for their chosen journey, and estimate their carbon emissions for 5 different modes of transport.
The user can compare and contrast each journey and view estimated tangible metrics necessary for carbon replacement. 

Our app offers users a clear breakdown of their travel choices on the environment, provide choice pathways to investgate or make changes to their travel habits.

A small blog section helps users further their research and frames it in a solution oriented way.
